### COMMUNITY
Open-Falcon is developed in the open. Here are some of the channels we use to communicate and contribute:

**Mailing lists:**
- [openfalcon-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openfalcon-users) – for discussions around openfalcon usage and community support
- [openfalcon-developers](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openfalcon-developers) – for discussions around openfalcon development

**Issue tracker:** 
- Use the GitHub issue tracker for the various [Open-Falcon repositories](http://github.com/open-falcon) to file bugs and features request. If you need support, please send your questions to the [openfalcon-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openfalcon-users) mailing list rather than filing a GitHub issue.

*Please do not ask individual project members for support. Use the channels above instead, where the whole community can help you and benefit from the solutions provided. If community support is insufficient for your situation, please refer to the Commercial Support section below.*

### CONTRIBUTING
We welcome community contributions! Open-Falcon uses GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests.

- If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request, addressing (with `@...`) the maintainer of this repository in the description of the pull request.
- If you plan to do something more involved, first discuss your ideas on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openfalcon-developers). This will avoid unnecessary work and surely give you and us a good deal of inspiration.
